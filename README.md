#SVM-Based Image Classification: Cats vs Dogs

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs using the popular Kaggle dataset, Dogs vs. Cats. The goal is to train a binary classifier that accurately predicts whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

Introduction
Image classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision. This project uses Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a robust supervised learning algorithm, to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. SVMs are particularly effective for binary classification tasks and provide a solid baseline for image classification before moving to deep learning techniques.

Features
Image Preprocessing: Resize, normalize, and flatten images for compatibility with SVM.
Binary Classification: Train an SVM classifier to predict cat vs. dog labels.
Customizable Pipeline: Adjust preprocessing steps, kernel types, and hyperparameters.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Requirements
Python 3.7+
Required libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
opencv-python
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/svm-cats-vs-dogs.git  
cd svm-cats-vs-dogs  
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Dataset
Download the dataset from Kaggle's Dogs vs. Cats competition. Extract the dataset and organize it as follows:

bash
Copy code
data/  
├── train/  
│   ├── cat.0.jpg  
│   ├── dog.0.jpg  
│   └── ...  
├── test/  
│   ├── cat.2000.jpg  
│   ├── dog.2000.jpg  
│   └── ...  
Place the dataset in the data/ folder. Ensure the training and testing sets are appropriately split.

Usage
Preprocess the data:

Resize images to a uniform size (e.g., 128x128).
Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1].
Flatten images into feature vectors for SVM compatibility.
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python svm_cats_dogs.py  
Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., kernel type, C, gamma) in the script to optimize performance.

Results
The output includes:

Accuracy of the SVM model on the test set.
Confusion matrix showing classification results.
Visualizations of incorrectly classified images for error analysis.
Example confusion matrix:
