Introduction
Customer segmentation is a crucial task in retail analytics. By grouping customers based on their purchase history, businesses can:

Tailor their marketing strategies.
Improve customer retention.
Enhance operational efficiency.
This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm, a popular unsupervised learning technique, to identify clusters of customers with similar purchasing behavior.

Features
Implementation of K-Means clustering from scratch or using popular libraries (e.g., scikit-learn).
Visual representation of customer clusters using 2D or 3D plots.
Flexible preprocessing options, including normalization and feature selection.
Hyperparameter tuning for the optimal number of clusters (k).
Requirements
Python 3.7+
Required libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kmeans-customer-segmentation.git
cd kmeans-customer-segmentation
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Place your dataset (.csv format) in the data/ folder.
Open the Jupyter Notebook or run the script:
bash
Copy code
python kmeans_clustering.py
Adjust parameters like the number of clusters (k) and preprocessing steps in the script.
Dataset
The dataset should contain customer purchase history, such as:

Customer ID
Purchase amount
Frequency of purchases
Categories of products purchased
If you donâ€™t have a dataset, a sample synthetic dataset is provided in the data/ folder.

Results
The output includes:

Cluster assignments for each customer.
Visualizations of clusters in 2D or 3D space.
Summary statistics for each cluster.
