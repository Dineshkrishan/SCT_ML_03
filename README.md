Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs

**SVM Image Classification**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs. Below is an overview of the project and how to use it.

**Contents**

SVM_Image_Classifier.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook file where the SVM classifier is implemented.

**Features**

Data Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, and splitting into training and test sets.

Model Implementation: Step-by-step construction of an SVM classifier.

Visualization: Graphical representation of the images and classification results.

Evaluation: Metrics to assess the performance of the classifier.

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.7 or above

Jupyter Notebook

Required Libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

OpenCV or PIL (for image processing)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/svm-image-classifier.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd svm-image-classifier

Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Prepare your dataset:

Place images of cats and dogs into separate folders (e.g., dataset/cats/ and dataset/dogs/).

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook "SVM_Image_Classifier.ipynb"

Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

**Results**

The notebook provides:

Insights into the dataset.

Visualization of sample images.

Confusion matrix and classification report.

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
